# Greeting Card

## Project Overview
In this project you will apply JavaScript to the DOM to create a greeting card on an HTML page.  

## Objectives

- [ ] Create HTML elements
- [ ] Use JavaScript to manipulate HTML elements
- [ ] Use variables to manage data

## Specifications

Create a Greeting Card on an HTML page.  Your Greeting Card should include at least 10 different HTML elements.  You must use JavaScript (only) to create and manipulate your elements in such a way that they come together to clearly resemble a picture.   Your Greeting Card should include a variety of colors (at least 5), text, an image, and music. 

## Your Tasks

- [ ] Locate the index.html page.  Here you will create the basic elements for your page.  You must include at least 10 different elements. 
- [ ] Locate the App.js file.  Write code to manipulate the elements on your index.html page
- [ ] Include music with your GreetingCard.  Below is an example of how to do this, 

```
var au = new Audio("Music/AllIWantForChristmas.mp3");
au.controls = true;
document.body.appendChild(au);
```

- [ ] Document your code thoroughly as you go with comments
- [ ] Complete the required README using specified guidelines

# Project 2: Happy Holidays Greeting Card

* Author: Stephanie Baier
* Class: AP Computer Science Principles Period 1
* Year: 2023

## Overview

My program creates a "Happy Holidays" card that shows a winter scene.  It includes animation and playable music.

## Compiling and Using

To open the card, double click on index.html and click "reveal in file explorer" to see it in your browser.  Once opened, press the play button (bottom left of the card) to play the music.

## Discussion

  * I had problems with creating an even border around the dark blue background (however, I figured this out).  The creation of the triangles for the Christmas tree went well.
  * I had to edit elements, save the file, and check if the elements were properly placed on the screen.
  * I had to research on my own how to download an mp3 file to upload it.  I also researched how to add a fancy font.
  * Most of my errors came from misspelling variables.  Or, I forgot to append a variable I had created.  I double checked spelling and made sure to append variables.
  * Making the background and adding an audio file were two new things I learned.
  * Something that clicked was how to change how an image or element was positioned by using style.top and style.left
  * I would not change anything about the project.
  * Knowing how to change element position and add audio will be helpful for the future.

## Testing

I inspected the file on the browser and did not come back with any errors.  I played the audio in the browser to make sure it worked.  I checked that all elements appeared in the browser.

## Extra Credit

I added a special font from a list of Javascript compatible fonts I researched. I added 7 images/animations (moon, deer, 4 lights, snowy hill), 7 colors, and 16 elements.

## Sources used

I used this website to find the font I used: https://www.fonts.com/font/itc 
I downloaded the mp3 from: https://pixabay.com/
